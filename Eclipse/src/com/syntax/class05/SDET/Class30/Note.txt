Maps in Java
Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in key value pairs


Benifits:

1. we can store two values inside the maps
2. searching is very effecient in maps


types of maps
1. HashMap, 2. LinkedHashMap , 3. TreeMap

1  HashMap:
1. Insertion order is not maintained (Downside)
2. insertion and retrieval is fastest (Upside)

2   LinkedHashMap
1. insertion order is maintained (Upside)
2. insertion spped is same as hashmap but retrieval speed is slowest
in all the maps.

3   TreeMap:

1. Data is stored in natural order by default
2. insertion speed is slowest but retrieval speed is better than
linkedHasMap but slower than HashMap

Map<String, String> students = new Map<>()



DifferencebetweenSet,ListandMapinJava?
• Set, List and Map are 3 important interface of Java collection framework.
 o List provides ordered and indexed collection which may contain duplication .
 o Set provides un-ordered collection of unique objects. Set doesn’t allowed duplication . List and Set are both extend
collection interface.
 o Map provides a data structure based on Key Value. Key is always unique, value can be dupl.

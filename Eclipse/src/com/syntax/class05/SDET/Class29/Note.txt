Note:

There are many many types of Hashset and there are many types of  list

We are limiting our self to those we use in testing


Set in Java:

Set is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by many classes for example.

 Hashset, LinkedHashSet and TreeHashSet


Properties of SEt:

All Sets don't allow duplicates

HashSet:

1. HashSet does not maintain the insertion order
2. it is the fastest in al lsets
3. it is most widely used Set.


LinkedHashSet:

1. Maintain the insertion order
2. slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet specially the insertions

TreeSet:
1. Sorts the data in natural order . for number in increasing order
2. it is the slowest when it comes to store the data.


When to use which type of Set:

1. If We dont care about insertion order and data being sorted always use HashSet
2. If we need the inseration order we dont have much choice, we have to use LinedHashSet
but if we dont care about the insertion order we can compare it with TreeSet

LinkedHasSet                     Vs               TreetHashSet

Insersation is not slow                          Slowest insertion
Retrievel is super slow                      Slower than HashSet but faster than LinkedHashSet
